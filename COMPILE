The project is set up to compile with makepp[1].
The Makeppfile might be compatible to good old make, in any case it should contain some hints for compilation options.

Quick build tutorial:
1. Goto the correct subdirectory of bulddir.
   In most cases you will want the form <platform>-on-<platform> where platform is your platform.
   It is quite probable that your platform is not yet supported, please contact me[2] and we will find a way to add it(1).
2. run `makepp CLI`


(1) Unless you plan some crazy stuff like your microwave...
