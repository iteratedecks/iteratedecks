Deck text files format notes:

// This is a comment line
// Special symbols are ':', ',', '[',']','(' and ')', don't use them in deck names or card names
// Also avoid using symbol '"', because it interferes with string adapter CommaText,
// which is used to extract card names in API, DLL uses another string adapter and it doesn't recognize '"'
// Every deck definition starts with deck name
// deck name is followed by ':' and then by card names
// card names start with commander name and then followed by rest of cards
// separated by comma ','
// You can use square brackets [ and ] to use card ID instead of card name or after card name,
// ID has higher priority and in second case card name will be ignored
// You can also use brackets ( and ) after card name to determine count of same copies of card in deck 
// Decks are indexed by name, if decks have same names, latest will overwrite all previous decks
// Cards from <Hidden> set can only be accessed by ID
// Examples:
// Example1:Atlas,Devastator(10)
// Example2:Atlas,Devastator(10)
// Example3:Atlas,Devastator(1)
// Example4:Atlas,[1](1)
// Example5:Atlas,[1](10)
// Example6:Atlas,[1]
